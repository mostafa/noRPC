# noRPC
A fault-tolerant, protocol-agnostic, dead simple, reliable, interoprable and secure RPC framework

There are great pieces of software written by great engineers doing a great job of interconnecting services. This framework, however, follows the [@kelseyhightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower)'s [nocode framework](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode). It follows the same architectural and design patterns and it offers lots of features on top of what is already offered by other frameworks:

- Fault-tolerant: there is absolutely no fault, either inherent, implicit or explicit.
- Protocol-agnostic: BRING YOUR OWN PROTOCOL.
- Dead simple: doing nothing is simple enough. It goes above and beyond that by literally doing nothing.
- Reliable: battle-tested against the latest technologies and advances of the human kind.
- Interoperable: it works with any technology you throw at it.
- Secure: you cannot attack nothing, unless you're a dark wizard that can bend space-time and mess with the dark matter.

## Getting Started
Sit there and watch. It works out of the box. If you want to know more, read this [article](https://mostafa.dev/the-ultimate-rpc-framework-9902bb0d6aed).

## Build from Source
No need. Spend your day doing nothing causes its source to be built automagically.

## Deploying
If you insist, you can just open a terminal (if you know what I mean) and watch it. You might wonder that it does nothing but wait for your input, but you aren't gonna do anything about it. This is how it is deployed.

## Contributing
A tiny star on the top right corner is what it takes to contribute to this awesome project. And help spread the word. Or do nothing, for that matter.
